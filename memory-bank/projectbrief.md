# RIFT - HUD/UI Integration Project Brief

## Project Overview
RIFT is a first-person shooter game built with Three.js that requires a comprehensive HUD/UI system. After 50 hours of development effort, the current modular UI architecture is failing to integrate properly, causing HUD elements to not display or function correctly.

## Core Problem Identified
The project transitioned from a working monolithic UI system (evidenced by the example files) to a fragmented modular architecture that broke the essential tight coupling between:
- DOM element creation and management
- CSS styling and element structure  
- JavaScript state management and updates
- Event coordination and timing

## Key Requirements
- Real-time HUD display (health, ammo, crosshair, minimap)
- Combat feedback system (damage indicators, hit markers)
- Notification and achievement system
- Menu and screen management
- Weather and environmental effects
- Objective and marker system
- Performance monitoring and debug tools

## Technical Stack
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- CSS3 with custom properties
- Event-driven architecture
- DOM-based UI elements

## Current Status
- Core game systems functional
- UI architecture in place but not integrating
- Individual UI components exist but don't connect properly
- CSS styling complete but not applied to correct elements
- Memory bank system needs implementation for project continuity

## Success Criteria
- All HUD elements visible and functional
- Smooth integration between UI systems
- Performance targets maintained (60fps)
- Maintainable, modular architecture that actually works
- Complete documentation for future development
