# Technical Context: RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign

## Project Overview

The RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign is a comprehensive update of the game's user interface systems. The project is focused on creating a modern, responsive, and performant UI layer that enhances gameplay feedback while maintaining the game's signature sci-fi aesthetic.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core programming language for all UI components
- **CSS3** - Styling with a focus on CSS variables and modern features
- **HTML5** - Base DOM structure
- **Three.js** - 3D rendering engine that the UI needs to integrate with
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

### Key Libraries & Dependencies

- No external UI frameworks (custom-built components)
- Core game engine (proprietary - built on Three.js)
- Asset management system for loading textures and sounds

## Architecture Overview

### Component-Based System

The UI is built using a component-based architecture with the following characteristics:

1. **UIComponent Base Class**
   - Provides common lifecycle methods: `init()`, `update()`, `render()`, `dispose()`
   - Manages parent-child relationships between components
   - Handles event subscription and cleanup
   - Provides animation utilities

2. **System Orchestrators**
   - HUDSystem, CombatSystem, NotificationSystem, etc.
   - Coordinate related components
   - Manage system-wide state
   - Handle communication between systems

3. **Individual Components**
   - Specialized for specific UI functionality
   - Extend UIComponent or appropriate sub-class
   - Follow consistent patterns for state management and rendering

### Event System

The project uses a centralized event system for communication between components, with the following features:

1. **EventManager**
   - Provides pub/sub functionality
   - Manages event subscriptions and cleanup
   - Handles debugging and event monitoring
   - Enhanced to support standardized events

2. **Event Standardization Implementation**
   - Standardized naming convention (`namespace:action` pattern)
   - Predefined payload structures for different event types
   - Helper methods for creating standardized payloads
   - Validation capabilities for event names and payloads
   - Migration utilities for updating legacy event usage

3. **Event Types**
   - State Change Events: For value changes (health, ammo, etc.)
   - Combat Events: For combat interactions (hits, damage, kills)
   - Notification Events: For user notifications
   - Progress Events: For progression updates (XP, levels, achievements)

4. **Standard Event Structure**
   - Common metadata (type, timestamp)
   - Type-specific required fields
   - Optional fields based on context

### DOM Management

The UI creates and manages DOM elements with the following approaches:

1. **DOMFactory**
   - Factory pattern for consistent DOM creation
   - Enforces BEM naming conventions with `rift-` prefix
   - Provides utility methods for common element types

2. **Component Rendering**
   - Components manage their own DOM elements
   - Clear separation between state and rendering
   - Uses CSS classes and attributes for styling
   - Minimizes direct style manipulation

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Batch DOM updates for high-frequency components
   - Use of requestAnimationFrame for rendering
   - CSS animations for performance
   - Hardware acceleration via transform/opacity

### CSS Architecture

The CSS follows BEM methodology with these organizational principles:

1. **CSS Organization**
   - Core files: variables, reset, typography, animations, layout
   - Utility files: mixins, helpers
   - Component files: organized by system
   - Responsive files: desktop, tablet, mobile adaptations

2. **BEM Naming Convention**
   - Block: `.rift-block`
   - Element: `.rift-block__element`
   - Modifier: `.rift-block__element--modifier`

3. **CSS Variables**
   - Color system
   - Spacing system
   - Typography system
   - Animation timing
   - Z-index management
   - JavaScript mirror of variables in `UIConfig.js`
