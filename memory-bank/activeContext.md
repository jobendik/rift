   - Ensuring proper material and texture handling

2. **Environmental System Enhancement**
   - Refining the day/night cycle system
   - Improving weather transitions and effects
   - Optimizing environmental effects for performance

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Implementing the advanced minimap system
   - Refining HUD elements for better player feedback
   - Enhancing pause screen functionality

4. **Physics and Navigation**
   - Implementing more robust collision detection
   - Optimizing navigation mesh performance
   - Improving path planning for AI entities

5. **Game Loop Stability**
   - Ensuring consistent frame rate across different devices
   - Implementing better error handling and recovery
   - Optimizing the update cycle for complex scenes

## Recent Changes

- Ensured lighting and shadow compatibility with current Three.js standards

### Enhanced Environmental System
- Implemented smooth transitions between different times of day
- Created a more sophisticated weather system with multiple weather types
- Added visual effects including rain particles, cloud sprites, and lightning
- Improved fog and atmospheric effects based on weather conditions

### UI System Improvements
- Designed a new minimap integration framework
- Enhanced loading screen with better progress indicators
- Improved pause screen handling with proper fullscreen and pointer lock management
- Added error recovery mechanisms for asset loading failures

### Control System Refinements
- Enhanced pointer lock handling for better browser compatibility
- Improved first-person controls responsiveness
- Added fallback mechanisms for different input methods
- Fixed issues with keyboard and mouse input synchronization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Evolution
- Deciding whether to further separate rendering from game logic
- Considering the implementation of a more formal component-entity system
- Evaluating performance costs of current architectural decisions
- Exploring potential refactoring to improve code organization

### Performance Optimizations
- Analyzing frame rate bottlenecks across different devices
- Evaluating the cost-benefit of various visual effects
- Considering different LOD (Level of Detail) strategies
- Exploring more efficient asset loading and management approaches

### Feature Prioritization
- Determining which gameplay features provide the most value
- Balancing visual quality against performance
- Evaluating which AI improvements would most enhance gameplay
- Deciding on which browser compatibilities to prioritize

### Technical Debt
- Identifying areas requiring refactoring
- Prioritizing bug fixes vs. new feature development
- Addressing inconsistencies in coding patterns
- Planning for long-term maintainability

## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals (Current Sprint)
1. Complete Three.js migration fixes for all rendering systems
2. Finalize and integrate the advanced minimap system
3. Fix remaining collision detection issues in complex geometry
4. Enhance enemy AI pathfinding in dynamic environments
5. Optimize the weather effect system for better performance

### Medium-term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Implement a more sophisticated weapon feedback system
2. Enhance the UI with better visual feedback during gameplay
3. Improve audio spatializion and environment-based sound effects
4. Add more diverse enemy behaviors and tactics
5. Create a more dynamic lighting system for atmospheric effects

### Long-term Goals
1. Explore potential for multiplayer capabilities
2. Implement a more sophisticated level progression system
3. Develop tools for easier content creation and level design
4. Investigate possibilities for cross-platform deployment
5. Create a more comprehensive game progression structure

## Development Workflow

### Current Branching Strategy
- `main` - Stable production code
- `develop` - Integration branch for feature work
- Feature branches for specific implementations
- Hotfix branches for critical issues

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing of gameplay mechanics
- Performance profiling on different hardware
- Browser compatibility testing
- Ad-hoc testing of new features

### Deployment Process
- Local development with Vite dev server
- Production builds via npm build script
- Manual deployment to hosting environments
- Version tracking via git tags

## Collaboration Focus

### Team Communication
- Regular code reviews for quality assurance
- Design discussions for major feature implementations
- Technical documentation updates for knowledge sharing
- Performance and issue tracking

### External Dependencies
- Monitoring Three.js and Yuka.js for updates and breaking changes
- Evaluating new web APIs that could enhance functionality
- Tracking browser vendor implementations of relevant features
- Considering additional libraries only when necessary

## Known Challenges

1. **Browser Compatibility** - Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers
2. **Performance Optimization** - Balancing visual quality with performance
3. **Mobile Support** - Adapting the experience for touch controls and smaller screens
4. **Asset Management** - Optimizing loading and memory usage for game assets
5. **AI Complexity** - Balancing sophisticated behavior with performance constraints
