# Active Context: RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully completed the HUD Components phase, Feedback Systems phase, Notification System phase, Menu System phase, and Progression System phase of the RIFT FPS UI/CSS redesign. We've also made significant progress on the Environmental Systems components, with both WeatherSystem and ObjectiveMarkerSystem now implemented as part of Phase 3 Advanced Features.

The Environmental Systems implementation includes:

- EnvironmentSystem: Coordinator for all environmental UI components
- CSS implementation following BEM methodology with dedicated files
- UI configuration options in UIConfig.js for both systems
- Marker animation system with pulse effects
- Distance indicator system for markers

We've successfully implemented:
- PowerupDisplay for active buffs and status effects with type-specific styling and animations

We have successfully implemented the DangerZone visualization for hazardous areas which includes:
- Different zone types (radiation, fire, electrical, poison, explosive, generic)
- Various shapes (circular, rectangular, polygon)
- Proximity warnings with screen effects
- Type-specific visual styling and animations
- Player danger detection with event emission
- Testing utilities for quick demonstration

In the Progression System phase, we implemented:
- ProgressionSystem to manage player XP, levels, and skill points
- ExperienceBar component with level-up animations and progress visualization
- PlayerRank component to display current rank with badge and title
- SkillPointsDisplay for skill point allocation and management
- CSS styling using BEM methodology with responsive design
- Event-based integration with gameplay systems
- Configuration through UIConfig settings
- Animation system for level-up celebrations and notifications

The Menu System is now complete with:
- ScreenManager for screen transitions and modal dialogs
- WeaponWheel for in-game weapon selection
- WorldMap for navigation and objective tracking
- MissionBriefing for mission details
- RoundSummary for end-of-round statistics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Environmental Systems Architecture**:
   - EnvironmentSystem serves as coordinator for all environmental UI components
   - Components follow BEM methodology with 'rift-' prefix
   - Marker system uses CSS animations for performance
   - Weather effects use a blend of CSS and canvas for optimal visuals
   - Weather intensity is configurable through UI settings
   - Danger zones use CSS for visual effects with JS for positioning
   - Proximity warnings use full-screen overlays with type-specific styling

2. **Menu System Architecture**:
   - ScreenManager serves as foundation for all menu screens and modals
   - Screens use a hierarchical navigation system with history tracking
   - Modal dialogs appear above current screens with backdrop
   - Focus management ensures keyboard accessibility
   - Animation system provides smooth transitions between screens
   - Event-driven communication with game systems

3. **Combat Feedback Architecture**:
   - CombatSystem serves as coordinator for all combat feedback components
   - Each feedback component extends UIComponent base class
   - Components handle their own lifecycle and animations
   - Event-based integration with gameplay systems

4. **CSS Strategy**:
   - Continuing BEM methodology with 'rift-' prefix
   - Combat component CSS files organized in dedicated directory
   - Animation-heavy with carefully tuned timing and effects
   - Responsive design considerations for different screen sizes

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Limiting DOM updates during rapid combat events
   - Using CSS animations for most visual effects
   - Implementing element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - Careful management of opacity/transform properties to avoid layout thrashing

6. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Clear and immediate feedback for player actions
   - Distinct visual language for different types of feedback
   - Balanced visual impact to avoid overwhelming the player
   - Consistent style matching AAA game quality standards

7. **Future Integration Considerations**:
   - Ensure combat feedback systems work with audio feedback
   - Coordinate with 3D effects for seamless experience
   - Plan for customization options in later phases
   - Account for accessibility considerations
