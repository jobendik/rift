# Active Context: RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign

## Current Work Focus

We are in the initial phase of the RIFT FPS UI/CSS redesign project, with a focus on the following priorities:

1. **Documentation & Planning**: Creating comprehensive Memory Bank documentation for project direction and requirements
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Understanding the current monolithic UIManager.js and planning its decomposition 
3. **CSS Structure Planning**: Organizing the CSS into a modular, maintainable system based on proposedCSSstructure.md
4. **Component Architecture Design**: Creating a component-based UI architecture following patterns in proposedUIManagerStructure

After reviewing the source files, we now have a clear understanding of the current implementation and the proposed architecture. The monolithic UIManager.js is feature-rich but lacks proper separation of concerns, while the proposed structure provides a clear path to modernizing the UI architecture.

## Recent Changes

As this is the project initialization phase, there have been no code changes yet. The following documentation has been established:

1. **Project Brief**: Core requirements, goals, and success criteria
2. **Product Context**: Project rationale and intended functionality
3. **System Patterns**: Architectural approach and key technical decisions 
4. **Tech Context**: Technologies, constraints, and technical opportunities
5. **Active Context**: Current work focus and next steps
6. **Progress**: Project status tracking
7. **.clinerules**: Project guidelines and standards

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps in the project are:

1. **Create core architecture**:
   - Implement `UIComponent` base class as a foundation for all UI elements
   - Create `EventManager` for standardized component communication
   - Develop `DOMFactory` for consistent DOM element creation
   - Establish `UIManager` as an orchestrator rather than implementer

2. **Establish CSS foundation**:
   - Create core variables file with color scheme, spacing, and typography
   - Set up modular component-specific CSS files
   - Implement animation system with keyframes in a central location
   - Create utility classes for common patterns

3. **Begin incremental refactoring**:
   - Start with self-contained UI elements like the health and ammo displays
   - Extract damage and hit indication systems into their own components
   - Refactor notification system
   - Implement progression system (XP, levels) as a dedicated component

4. **Advanced feature implementation**:
   - Enhance damage feedback with better directional indicators
   - Improve crosshair system with more contextual feedback
   - Create a more engaging kill feed and achievement system
   - Implement weather effects and environmental feedback

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Active Architectural Decisions

1. **Component Granularity**
   - Question: How fine-grained should components be?
   - Current Thinking: Each logical UI element (health bar, ammo display, etc.) should be its own component, but avoid over-atomization that creates unnecessary complexity.
   - Impact: Affects maintenance overhead, reusability, and testing strategy.

2. **Event System Design**
   - Question: How should we structure the event system?
   - Current Thinking: Implement a centralized EventManager with namespaced event types, standardized event objects, and automatic cleanup on component disposal.
   - Impact: Critical for ensuring components can communicate without tight coupling.

3. **DOM Management Strategy**
   - Question: How should components interact with the DOM?
   - Current Thinking: Each component should own its DOM elements and have responsibility for creating, updating, and disposing of them, facilitated by a central DOMFactory.
   - Impact: Affects rendering performance and prevents "DOM thrashing."

4. **CSS Architecture**
   - Question: How should we organize CSS for maximum maintainability?
   - Current Thinking: Component-specific CSS files with BEM methodology, CSS variables for theming, and utility classes for common patterns.
   - Impact: Ensures styling changes don't cause unintended side effects.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Refactoring Approach**
   - Question: How do we refactor while maintaining a working game?
   - Current Thinking: Create adapter layer that maps old UIManager API to new component system, allowing incremental migration.
   - Impact: Enables continuous development without breaking existing functionality.

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Question: How do we ensure new UI doesn't impact game performance?
   - Current Thinking: Implement performance tracking in debug mode, set budgets for UI operations, use efficient rendering techniques.
   - Impact: Critical for maintaining smooth gameplay with enhanced visual effects.

3. **Feature Priorities**
   - Question: Which UI enhancements should be implemented first?
   - Current Thinking: Focus on core gameplay feedback (health, ammo, hit indicators) before adding more "nice-to-have" features.
   - Impact: Ensures the most important elements are polished before secondary features.

4. **Animation Strategy**
   - Question: How do we handle animations efficiently?
   - Current Thinking: Use CSS animations for simple transitions, requestAnimationFrame for complex animations, avoid JS animations that block the main thread.
   - Impact: Significant for perceived performance and visual polish.

## Current Challenges

1. **Complex UIManager**
   - The current UIManager.js has extensive functionality (2000+ lines) that needs careful decomposition
   - Many methods reference each other, creating complex dependencies
   - Directly modifies DOM elements throughout the code
   - Manages both 3D (Three.js) and 2D (DOM) elements

2. **Resource Management**
   - Current implementation doesn't properly clean up resources, potentially causing memory leaks
   - Event listeners need systematic tracking and removal
   - DOM elements are created but not always properly removed

3. **State Management**
   - Game state is often directly accessed instead of being properly observed
   - UI updates are triggered both by events and direct method calls
   - Need to standardize the flow of data into UI components

4. **Mixed Rendering Approaches**
   - The current implementation mixes Three.js rendering (for sprites) and DOM manipulation
   - Need to determine the best approach for different UI elements

## Integration Touchpoints

1. **World Object**
   - Core game state container that UIManager receives in constructor
   - Contains references to player, enemies, and game systems
   - New architecture needs to maintain this integration point

2. **Player Object**
   - Contains health, weapons, position information
   - UI needs to observe changes to player state

3. **WeaponSystem**
   - Manages weapons and ammunition
   - UI needs to reflect current weapon and ammo status

4. **Asset Manager**
   - Loads textures and other assets used by the UI
   - New component system needs access to these resources

5. **Input Handling**
   - Current UIManager handles many input events directly
   - Need to create a dedicated input handler component

## Feature Inventory

Based on the current UIManager.js, we need to maintain and enhance these key features:

1. **Core HUD Elements**
   - Health display with low/critical states
   - Ammo counter with magazine visualization
   - Crosshair system with context-aware behavior
   - Minimap with player and enemy positions
   - Compass for orientation

2. **Feedback Systems**
   - Hit indicators (when player hits enemies)
   - Damage indicators (when player takes damage)
   - Kill confirmations and kill streaks
   - Floating damage numbers
   - Screen effects (damage flash, healing glow)

3. **Notification Systems**
   - Kill feed with weapon icons
   - Event banners for significant events
   - Contextual notifications
   - Achievement popups

4. **Menu Systems**
   - Weapon wheel for selection
   - World map for navigation
   - Mission briefing screen
   - Round summary/statistics

5. **Progression System**
   - Player level and XP tracking
   - Experience bar visualization
   - Rank display and progression

6. **Environmental Elements**
   - Weather effects (rain, etc.)
   - Footstep indicators
   - Objective markers
   - Power-up status indicators
