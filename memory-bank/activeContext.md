# Active Context: RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully completed the HUD Components phase, the Feedback Systems phase, and the Notification System phase of the RIFT FPS UI/CSS redesign. We're now preparing to begin the Menu System phase.

In the Feedback Systems phase, we implemented:
- HitIndicator: Visual feedback for landing hits on enemies
- DamageIndicator: Directional indicators showing where damage is coming from
- DamageNumbers: Floating combat text showing damage dealt
- ScreenEffects: Visual effects for player state (damage, healing, etc.)
- FootstepIndicator: Directional awareness of nearby movement

The latest component we've implemented is the FootstepIndicator, which provides:
- Directional awareness of enemy and friendly footstep sounds
- Distance-based intensity scaling for proximity detection
- Friend/foe differentiation with distinct visual styling
- Support for continuous tracking (running) versus single steps
- Integration with the CombatSystem and event pipeline

The most recent component implementation order was:
1. NotificationManager ✅
2. KillFeed ✅
3. EventBanner ✅ 
4. AchievementDisplay ✅

With this, we have successfully completed all planned components in the Notification System phase and are ready to move on to the Menu System phase.

   - Create event handlers for menu navigation
   - Implement focus management system for menus
   
3. **Refine Event System Integration**:
   - Continue standardizing event names and payload structures
   - Create constants for common event types
   - Document event flows between components
   
4. **Update Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Document Feedback Systems architecture
   - Create detailed component reference for completed feedback components
   - Update system patterns with learned insights

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Combat Feedback Architecture**:
   - CombatSystem serves as coordinator for all combat feedback components
   - Each feedback component extends UIComponent base class
   - Components handle their own lifecycle and animations
   - Event-based integration with gameplay systems

2. **CSS Strategy**:
   - Continuing BEM methodology with 'rift-' prefix
   - Combat component CSS files organized in dedicated directory
   - Animation-heavy with carefully tuned timing and effects
   - Responsive design considerations for different screen sizes

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Limiting DOM updates during rapid combat events
   - Using CSS animations for most visual effects
   - Implementing element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - Careful management of opacity/transform properties to avoid layout thrashing

4. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Clear and immediate feedback for player actions
   - Distinct visual language for different types of feedback
   - Balanced visual impact to avoid overwhelming the player
   - Consistent style matching AAA game quality standards

5. **Future Integration Considerations**:
   - Ensure combat feedback systems work with audio feedback
   - Coordinate with 3D effects for seamless experience
   - Plan for customization options in later phases
   - Account for accessibility considerations
