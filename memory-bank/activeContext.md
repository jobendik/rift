# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving the event system performance monitoring and standardization to ensure the game's UI remains responsive and efficient.

### Event System Performance Monitoring

We've implemented a comprehensive event performance tracking system that allows the development team to monitor and optimize event-driven interactions. The system can identify high-frequency events and slow event handlers that might be causing performance issues.

Key components of the system include:
- Performance metrics tracking in the EventManager
- Configuration options in UIConfig.js
- UIManager integration for enabling tracking
- A dedicated performance monitoring dashboard UI

### Developer Tools Integration

We've added a developer tools panel accessible via Ctrl+Shift+D that provides quick access to:
- Event Performance Monitor
- Event Test Page
- Event Standardization Index

This helps streamline the development workflow and makes it easier to debug and optimize the game.

## Recent Changes

1. Enhanced the EventManager to track performance metrics for events
2. Added configuration options in UIConfig.js for performance monitoring settings
3. Created a comprehensive event performance monitoring dashboard
4. Integrated the developer tools panel into the main game UI
5. Added keyboard shortcut for accessing developer tools

## Active Decisions

- **Adopt Element Pooling**: For frequent UI elements (like damage numbers), we'll implement element pooling to reduce DOM operations and garbage collection.
- **Batch DOM Operations**: Group DOM updates to minimize reflows and repaints.
- **Use Performance Metrics**: Use the new performance monitoring dashboard to identify and fix bottlenecks.
- **Throttle High-Frequency Events**: Events firing more than 60 times per second should be throttled or batched.

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the event standardization across all UI components
2. Add element pooling for high-frequency UI elements (damage numbers, hit markers)
3. Optimize slow event handlers identified by the performance monitoring system
4. Enhance animation performance using requestAnimationFrame and CSS transitions
5. Document performance best practices for the team

## Current Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| EventManager Performance Tracking | Complete | Added metrics collection for frequency and execution time |
| Performance Monitoring Dashboard | Complete | Provides real-time analysis and recommendations |
| Developer Tools Panel | Complete | Accessible via Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut |
| UIManager Integration | Complete | Auto-enables performance tracking based on config |
| Element Pooling | Planned | Will be implemented for frequent UI elements |

## Outstanding Issues

- Need to optimize hit indicators and damage numbers that currently create many DOM elements
- Several events are firing at very high frequencies and need throttling
- Some event handlers are performing expensive DOM operations synchronously
