# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving UI performance through event system optimization and DOM element pooling to ensure the game's UI remains responsive and efficient, even during intensive combat sequences.

### Event System Performance Monitoring

We've implemented a comprehensive event performance tracking system that allows the development team to monitor and optimize event-driven interactions. The system can identify high-frequency events and slow event handlers that might be causing performance issues.

Key components of the system include:
- Performance metrics tracking in the EventManager
- Configuration options in UIConfig.js
- UIManager integration for enabling tracking
- A dedicated performance monitoring dashboard UI

### Developer Tools Integration

We've added a developer tools panel accessible via Ctrl+Shift+D that provides quick access to:
- Event Performance Monitor
- Event Test Page
- Event Standardization Index

This helps streamline the development workflow and makes it easier to debug and optimize the game.

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented the ElementPool utility for efficient DOM element reuse
2. Created the EnhancedDamageNumbers component using element pooling
3. Implemented the EnhancedHitIndicator component using element pooling
4. Implemented the EnhancedDamageIndicator component using element pooling
5. Implemented the EnhancedFootstepIndicator component using element pooling
6. Created the EnhancedKillFeed component using element pooling for kill messages and streaks
7. Integrated EnhancedKillFeed into NotificationSystem for improved performance
8. Modified CombatSystem to use enhanced components by default for better performance
9. Added comprehensive documentation for element pooling in docs/ElementPooling.md
10. Enhanced the EventManager to track performance metrics for events
11. Added configuration options in UIConfig.js for performance monitoring settings
12. Created a comprehensive event performance monitoring dashboard
13. Integrated the developer tools panel into the main game UI
14. Added keyboard shortcut for accessing developer tools

## Active Decisions

- **Element Pooling Implementation**: We're implementing element pooling for frequent UI elements to reduce DOM operations and garbage collection. The EnhancedDamageNumbers component serves as the first implementation and template for other components.
- **Batch DOM Operations**: Group DOM updates to minimize reflows and repaints.
- **Use Performance Metrics**: Use the new performance monitoring dashboard to identify and fix bottlenecks.
- **Throttle High-Frequency Events**: Events firing more than 60 times per second should be throttled or batched.

## Next Steps

1. Continue upgrading remaining UI components to use ElementPool (NotificationManager, EventBanner, AchievementDisplay, etc.)
2. Complete event standardization across all UI components
3. Optimize slow event handlers identified by the performance monitoring system
4. Enhance animation performance using requestAnimationFrame and CSS transitions
5. Document performance best practices for the team

## Outstanding Issues

- Need to upgrade remaining UI components to use element pooling (NotificationManager, EventBanner, AchievementDisplay, etc.)
- Several events are firing at very high frequencies and need throttling
- Some event handlers are performing expensive DOM operations synchronously
- Some components still create excessive DOM nodes during high-frequency updates
