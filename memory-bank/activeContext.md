     - Suggest payload structure changes for standardization
     - Generate documentation comments for event handlers
   - The Event Standardization Index provides visual progress tracking

   - Prioritize CSS animations over JavaScript where appropriate
   - Implement element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for animations
   - Consider batching DOM operations for components with frequent updates
   - Profile all UI components during intensive gameplay scenarios

5. **Audio Integration Planning**:
   - Establish a similar component-based architecture for UI sounds
