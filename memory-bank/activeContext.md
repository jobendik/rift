# Active Context: RIFT FPS UI/CSS Redesign

## Current Work Focus

We are now transitioning from the HUD Components phase to the Feedback Systems phase of the RIFT FPS UI/CSS redesign. With all core HUD components now implemented (HealthDisplay, AmmoDisplay, CrosshairSystem, MinimapSystem, StaminaSystem, and CompassDisplay), we've begun implementing combat feedback systems to enhance player experience.

The Feedback Systems phase focuses on:
- HitIndicator: Visual feedback for landing hits on enemies
- DamageIndicator: Directional indicators showing where damage is coming from
- DamageNumbers: Floating combat text showing damage dealt
- ScreenEffects: Visual effects for player state (damage, healing, etc.)
- FootstepIndicator: Directional awareness of nearby movement

We've just completed the first component in this phase: the HitIndicator system with support for:
- Regular hit markers
- Critical hit markers with distinct visual styling
- Headshot hit markers with enhanced visual impact
- Directional damage indicators for all four cardinal directions
- Kill confirmation animations

The current component implementation order is:
1. HitIndicator ✅
2. DamageIndicator ✅
3. DamageNumbers (next)
4. ScreenEffects (planned)
5. FootstepIndicator (planned)

## Recent Changes

- Completed the CompassDisplay component with rotational logic and waypoint markers
- Created new combat feedback system architecture:
  - Implemented `CombatSystem` class as a coordinator for combat feedback components
  - Set up directory structure for combat-related components
  - Established CSS organization for combat feedback elements
- Implemented the HitIndicator component with:
  - Support for regular, critical, and headshot hit markers
  - Directional damage indicators
  - Kill confirmation animations
  - Event-based integration with gameplay systems
- Implemented the DamageIndicator component with:
  - 360-degree directional damage visualization
  - Intensity-based feedback (low, medium, high damage)
  - Customizable duration and appearance
  - Cone-shaped visual indicators showing damage source
- Updated the CombatSystem to integrate both hit and damage indicators
- Created CSS structure for combat feedback:
  - Added `public/styles/components/combat/_hit-indicator.css`
  - Added `public/styles/components/combat/_damage-indicator.css`
  - Created `public/styles/components/combat.css` as an import file
  - Updated main CSS to include combat styles
- Enhanced UIConfig.js with expanded combat feedback configuration options
- Integrated CombatSystem into UIManager with test methods for demonstration

## Next Steps

1. **Create DamageNumbers System**:
   - Implement floating damage numbers
   - Add visual differentiation for critical hits
   - Create animation system for rising/fading numbers
   - Implement stacking for rapid damage events

3. **Develop ScreenEffects System**:
   - Create screen flash effects for damage taken
   - Implement healing glow effects
   - Add screen shake for significant impacts
   - Create vignette effects for low health

4. **Refine Event System Integration**:
   - Continue standardizing event names and payload structures
   - Create constants for common event types
   - Document event flows between components

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Combat Feedback Architecture**:
   - CombatSystem serves as coordinator for all combat feedback components
   - Each feedback component extends UIComponent base class
   - Components handle their own lifecycle and animations
   - Event-based integration with gameplay systems

2. **CSS Strategy**:
   - Continuing BEM methodology with 'rift-' prefix
   - Combat component CSS files organized in dedicated directory
   - Animation-heavy with carefully tuned timing and effects
   - Responsive design considerations for different screen sizes

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Limiting DOM updates during rapid combat events
   - Using CSS animations for most visual effects
   - Implementing element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - Careful management of opacity/transform properties to avoid layout thrashing

4. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Clear and immediate feedback for player actions
   - Distinct visual language for different types of feedback
   - Balanced visual impact to avoid overwhelming the player
   - Consistent style matching AAA game quality standards

5. **Future Integration Considerations**:
   - Ensure combat feedback systems work with audio feedback
   - Coordinate with 3D effects for seamless experience
   - Plan for customization options in later phases
   - Account for accessibility considerations

## Current Achievements and Progress

1. **HUD Component Implementation**
   - Successfully implemented all planned HUD components:
     - HealthDisplay with critical/low health states
     - AmmoDisplay with magazine visualization
     - CrosshairSystem with dynamic spread
     - MinimapSystem with enemy tracking
     - StaminaSystem with sprint mechanics
     - CompassDisplay with directional awareness

2. **Feedback Systems**
   - Implemented combat feedback components:
     - HitIndicator with support for different hit types and directional indicators
     - DamageIndicator with 360-degree directional damage visualization
     - Both systems feature intensity-based feedback and animations
   - Established architecture for remaining feedback systems 
   - Created CSS foundation for combat feedback elements with BEM methodology
   - Integrated components with CombatSystem coordinator

3. **UI System Architecture**
   - Expanded UIManager to support combat feedback systems
   - Enhanced configuration options in UIConfig.js
   - Maintained consistent component lifecycle pattern
   - Added testing capabilities for combat feedback components

## Current Challenges

1. **Animation Performance**
   - Balancing visual impact with performance considerations
   - Managing multiple simultaneous animations
   - Ensuring smooth performance during intensive combat

2. **Event Standardization**
   - Creating consistent event naming and payload structures
   - Ensuring proper event flow between gameplay and UI systems
   - Preventing event listener leaks during rapid UI updates

3. **Visual Clarity**
   - Ensuring feedback is clear without being distracting
   - Balancing information density with visual simplicity
   - Creating distinct but cohesive visual language for different feedback types

4. **Integration with Game Systems**
   - Coordinating hit detection with visual feedback
   - Timing animations with gameplay events
   - Ensuring accurate directional information
