## Known Issues

Based on current implementation, there are a few areas that need attention:

1. **Architecture Refinement**
   - Current UIManager has placeholders for systems that need implementation
   - Integration between UIComponent and EventManager works but lacks standard event conventions
   - No standardized approach for component-to-component communication yet

2. **CSS Integration**
   - New CSS architecture needs to be integrated with existing components
   - Need to migrate existing component CSS to new BEM structure
   - Need to ensure proper usage of the new CSS utility classes

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Balance between CSS and JavaScript animations needs to be determined
   - No element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - DOM batch operations needed for frequently updated elements

4. **Future Integration**
   - Need strategy for integrating with Three.js for 3D elements
   - Input handling for both UI and game interactions needs coordination
   - Game state observation pattern not fully established

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - ✅ Event system implementation details (completed with EventManager)
   - ✅ DOM creation approach (completed with DOMFactory)
   - ✅ Component lifecycle methods (completed with UIComponent)
   - ✅ CSS architecture implementation (completed with new CSS structure) 
   - [ ] Strategy for animation performance (considering both CSS and JS animations)
   - [ ] Approach for Three.js integration
   - [ ] Testing methodology

3. **Implementation Requirements**
   - ✅ Understanding `World` class API
   - [ ] Component-specific design details

   - [ ] Performance benchmarks for UI operations

## Additional Notes

**Architecture Strengths**:
- The UIComponent base class is very robust with comprehensive lifecycle methods
- EventManager provides solid foundation for decoupled communication
- DOMFactory ensures consistent DOM creation and styling
- New UIManager successfully implements orchestrator pattern

**Areas for Enhancement**:
- Consider moving more animations to CSS for performance
- Event naming conventions should be standardized
- Component testing strategy needed
- Consider documentation for standard component API

**Next Implementation Focus**:
- Implement remaining HUD components (crosshair, minimap, compass)
- Create JavaScript components to use new CSS structures
- Develop feedback systems (hit indicators, damage)
- Create notification system
