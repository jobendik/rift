## Known Issues

Based on current implementation, there are a few areas that need attention:

1. **Event Standardization**
   - Need consistent event naming conventions across components
   - Need standardized payload structures for common event types
   - Need documentation of event flows between components

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Balance between CSS and JavaScript animations needs optimization
   - Element pooling needed for frequently created/destroyed elements
   - DOM batch operations needed for frequently updated elements
   - Performance monitoring during intensive gameplay scenarios

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Coordinating hit detection with visual feedback
   - Timing animations with gameplay events
   - Ensuring accurate directional information for markers and indicators
   - Integration between DOM-based UI and Three.js rendered elements

4. **Visual Clarity**
   - Ensuring feedback is clear without being distracting
   - Balancing information density with visual simplicity
   - Creating distinct but cohesive visual language for different feedback types
