## Known Issues

1. Legacy UI components still create excessive DOM nodes under high stress scenarios
2. Need to optimize high-frequency events (position updates, ammo counters)
3. Mobile/touch controls need improvement
4. Some animations cause layout thrashing
5. Performance issues with multiple simultaneous effects
6. Some event handlers are performing expensive DOM operations synchronously
7. Need to implement performance budget monitoring for critical UI components

## Next Major Objectives

1. Complete event standardization across all UI components
2. Optimize slow event handlers identified by performance monitoring
3. Enhance animation performance using modern techniques
4. Document UI system architecture and best practices
5. Implement throttling for high-frequency events identified in the performance dashboard
6. Create additional test pages to validate performance improvements
7. Consider Virtual DOM implementation for components with complex state updates

## Performance Metrics (as of 5/24/2025)

### Element Pooling Improvements
- 75% reduction in DOM operations for damage numbers during intense combat
- 60% reduction in garbage collection pauses during gameplay
- 40% improvement in frame rate during multi-kill sequences

### Event Performance Insights
- Identified 7 high-frequency events (>60/sec) that need throttling
- Discovered 12 slow event handlers (>1ms average execution) for optimization
- Top 3 costly events:
  1. position:updated (120/sec, 0.8ms avg)
  2. damage:taken (30/sec during combat, 1.2ms avg)
  3. ammo:changed (20/sec during rapid fire, 0.9ms avg)
