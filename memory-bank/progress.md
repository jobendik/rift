   - Created comprehensive performance monitoring dashboard
   - Integrated developer tools panel with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D)
   - Added real-time recommendations for performance optimizations

2. **Enhanced Movement System** (5/17/2025)
   - Added movement-based UI feedback
   - Implemented footstep indicator system
   - Created visual stamina system
   - Added movement state transitions and animations

3. **Environment System** (5/10/2025)
   - Weather effects (rain, snow, fog)
   - Dynamic lighting impact on UI
   - Objective marker system
   - Danger zone visualization
   - Power-up feedback

4. **Combat Feedback Enhancements** (5/2/2025)
   - Enhanced damage indicators with directional awareness
   - Improved hit markers with critical hit feedback
   - Dynamic crosshair that responds to player state and actions
   - Advanced screen effects for different damage types

## Known Issues

1. Some UI elements create excessive DOM nodes under high stress scenarios
2. Need to optimize high-frequency events (position updates, ammo counters)
3. Mobile/touch controls need improvement
4. Some animations cause layout thrashing
5. Performance issues with multiple simultaneous effects

## Next Major Objectives

1. Implement UI element pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
2. Complete event standardization across all components
3. Optimize slow event handlers identified by performance monitoring
4. Enhance animation performance using modern techniques
5. Document UI system architecture and best practices
