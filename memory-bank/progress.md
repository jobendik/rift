## Known Issues

1. Legacy UI components still create excessive DOM nodes under high stress scenarios
2. Need to migrate remaining UI components to use ElementPool
3. Need to optimize high-frequency events (position updates, ammo counters)
4. Mobile/touch controls need improvement
5. Some animations cause layout thrashing
6. Performance issues with multiple simultaneous effects

## Next Major Objectives

1. Upgrade remaining UI components to use ElementPool (notification manager, event banners, and others)
2. Complete event standardization across all components
3. Optimize slow event handlers identified by performance monitoring
4. Enhance animation performance using modern techniques
5. Document UI system architecture and best practices
