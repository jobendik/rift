## Known Issues

1. Legacy UI components still create excessive DOM nodes under high stress scenarios
2. Need to migrate remaining UI components to use ElementPool
3. Need to optimize high-frequency events (position updates, ammo counters)
4. Mobile/touch controls need improvement
5. Some animations cause layout thrashing
6. Performance issues with multiple simultaneous effects
7. Some event handlers are performing expensive DOM operations synchronously
8. Need to implement performance budget monitoring for critical UI components

## Next Major Objectives

1. Upgrade remaining UI components to use ElementPool (notification manager, event banners, and others)
2. Complete event standardization across all components
3. Optimize slow event handlers identified by performance monitoring
4. Enhance animation performance using modern techniques
5. Document UI system architecture and best practices
6. Implement throttling for high-frequency events identified in the performance dashboard
7. Create additional test pages to validate performance improvements
8. Consider Virtual DOM implementation for components with complex state updates
