## Known Issues

Based on code review of the current implementation, we've identified these issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Architectural Issues**
   - The UIManager class is monolithic (2000+ lines) with too many responsibilities
   - Direct DOM manipulation scattered throughout the code
   - No clear component lifecycle (initialization, updates, disposal)
   - Mixed 3D (Three.js) and DOM-based UI rendering without clear separation
   - Event listeners registered but not always cleaned up on disposal

2. **CSS Organization Issues**
   - Styles spread across multiple files with inconsistent organization
   - Inline styles applied directly in JavaScript
   - Limited use of CSS variables for theming
   - No clear methodology for naming CSS classes
   - Potential specificity conflicts in current CSS

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - DOM elements created/removed frequently without optimizations
   - Animations potentially causing layout thrashing
   - Heavy use of JavaScript animations instead of CSS transitions
   - No visible performance budget or monitoring
   - Multiple simultaneous effects could impact frame rate

4. **Feature Implementation Issues**
   - Current directional damage indicators lack clarity
   - Hit feedback could be more satisfying and clear
   - Notification system doesn't handle multiple notifications well
   - Power-up display lacks visual hierarchy
   - Weather effects implementation is basic

## Blockers and Dependencies

1. **Code Understanding**
   - [x] Review `codeForUIManager.js` to understand current implementation
   - [x] Study `proposedUIManagerStructure` to understand target architecture
   - [x] Analyze `codeForImprovedCss` to understand CSS improvements
   - [x] Examine `proposedCSSstructure.md` for CSS organization plan

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - [ ] Finalize event system implementation details
      - Need to determine exact event format and naming conventions
      - Need to decide on event propagation and handling mechanism
   - [ ] Decide on DOM creation approach
      - Whether to use templates, document fragments, or direct creation
      - How to handle dynamic updates efficiently
   - [ ] Determine rendering strategy for different component types
      - Which components use DOM vs Three.js
      - How to optimize rendering for performance-critical components
   - [ ] Choose CSS implementation methodology
      - Confirm BEM naming with prefix (e.g., `rift-block__element--modifier`)
      - Decide on CSS variables scope and organization

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - [ ] Understand `World` class API for game state access
   - [ ] Review `Player` interface for health and status information
   - [ ] Analyze `WeaponSystem` for ammunition and weapon state
   - [ ] Examine `AssetManager` for resource loading patterns

## Additional Notes

- The current implementation has many features that need to be preserved, including:
  - Dynamic crosshairs that change based on player state
  - Directional damage indicators
  - Kill feed and streak notifications
  - Level and progression system
  - Weather effects
  - Minimap with player and enemy indicators
  
- The code shows potential memory leaks in event handling that need to be addressed
  - Many event listeners are added but never removed
  - DOM elements are created but not always properly disposed

- Performance considerations are especially important for:
  - Damage numbers (many can appear simultaneously)
  - Weather effects (particularly rain)
  - Screen shake and flash effects
  - Notifications that can stack

- Both improved CSS and improved JavaScript architecture will benefit from:
  - Consistent naming patterns
  - Clear component responsibilities
  - Proper event cleanup
  - Optimized rendering strategies
