   - Created proper handler methods for events (`_onRoundCompleted` and `_onStatsUpdated`)
   - Added standardized JSDoc comments with payload information

## Features of the Event Standardization System

The Event Standardization system consists of:

1. **EventManager**: Core event bus with standardized event handling
   - Implements the pub/sub pattern for component communication
   - Provides validation for event names and payloads
   - Includes helper methods for creating standardized event objects

2. **EventStandardizationImplementer**: Utility to help implement standardization
   - Maps old event names to standardized names
   - Provides templates for standardized event payloads
   - Includes tools for analyzing and migrating components

## Naming Conventions

Events follow two patterns:
- Standard events: `namespace:action` (e.g., `health:changed`)
- Component-specific events: `namespace:id:action` (e.g., `ui:health-display:visible`)

Actions are consistently named using past tense for events that have occurred:
- ✅ `changed` (not `change`)
- ✅ `activated` (not `activate`)
- ✅ `position-changed` (not `position`)
- ✅ `modal-shown` (not `showModal`)

## Current Progress

As of May 23, 2025, the following progress has been made:

| System | Progress | Components Updated |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Notification System | 100% | NotificationManager, KillFeed, EventBanner, AchievementDisplay |
| Combat System | 100% | HitIndicator, CombatSystem, EnhancedHitIndicator, DamageIndicator |
| Movement System | 100% | MovementSystem, FootstepIndicator |
| HUD System | 100% | MinimapSystem, CompassDisplay, StaminaSystem, CrosshairSystem, HealthDisplay, AmmoDisplay, WeaponWheel |
| Menu System | 100% | WorldMap, ScreenManager, MissionBriefing, RoundSummary |
| Environment System | 100% | ObjectiveMarkerSystem, EnvironmentSystem, PowerupDisplay, WeatherSystem, DangerZone |
| Progression System | 100% | PlayerRank, ExperienceBar, SkillPointsDisplay |
| Utility Components | 100% | InputHandler |
| Overall | 100% | - |

## ✅ Event Standardization Complete

1. **Component Migration**:
   - ✅ All UI components now use standardized event names
   - ✅ ScreenManager component standardization (completed May 23, 2025):
     - Changed `ui:showScreen` → `ui:screen-shown` for consistent action-based naming
     - Changed `ui:hideScreen` → `ui:screen-hidden` for consistent action-based naming
     - Changed `ui:showModal` → `ui:modal-shown` for consistent action-based naming
     - Changed `ui:hideModal` → `ui:modal-hidden` for consistent action-based naming
     - Changed `ui:goBack` → `ui:back-navigated` to follow past tense pattern
     - Changed `screen:show` → `screen:shown` to use past tense for events
     - Changed `screen:hide` → `screen:hidden` to use past tense for events
     - Changed `modal:show` → `modal:shown` to use past tense for events
     - Changed `modal:hide` → `modal:hidden` to use past tense for events
     - Added new event `screen:transition-completed` for animation completion
     - Added timestamp to all event payloads
     - Added consistent data properties for consistent state representation
   - ✅ InputHandler utility component (standardized all input events):
     - Changed `input:blur` → `input:blurred`
     - Changed `input:weaponwheel:toggle` → `input:weaponwheel:shown`/`input:weaponwheel:hidden`
     - Changed `input:scoreboard:toggle` → `input:scoreboard:shown`/`input:scoreboard:hidden`
     - Changed `input:pause:toggle` → `input:pause-toggled`
     - Changed `input:map:toggle` → `input:map-toggled`
     - Changed `input:weapon:reload` → `input:weapon:reloaded`
     - Changed `input:player:sprint` → `input:player:sprint-started`/`input:player:sprint-stopped`
     - Changed `input:weapon:select` → `input:weapon:selected`
     - Added timestamps to all event payloads

2. **Event Payload Standardization**:
   - ✅ All event payloads now follow standard templates
   - ✅ Implemented payload validation where appropriate
   - ✅ Added timestamps to all events
   - ✅ Standardized state change events with value/previous fields

3. **Documentation**:
   - ✅ Created a comprehensive event catalog with all standard events in `EventStandardizationCatalog.md`
   - ✅ Documented standardized payload structures and templates for each event type
   - ✅ Added usage examples for publishing and subscribing to events

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Clear patterns make the codebase more predictable
- **Discoverability**: Standardized naming makes events easier to find and understand
- **Maintainability**: Common patterns reduce the learning curve for new developers
- **Reliability**: Validation helps catch errors early

## Testing

To verify event standardization:
1. Use `EventStandardizationImplementer.analyzeComponent()` to check components
2. Run the event standardization tests to verify compatibility
3. Manually test affected components to ensure functionality is maintained
