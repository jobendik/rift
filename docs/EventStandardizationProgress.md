# Event Standardization Implementation Progress

## Changes Made

1. Updated event names in the WorldMap component:
   - Changed event subscription from `player:position` → `player:position-changed` to follow the standardized pattern
   - Updated modal events from `ui:showModal` → `ui:modal-shown` for consistency with action-based naming

2. Updated event names in environment components:
   - In ObjectiveMarkerSystem:
     - Changed `window:resize` → `window:resized` to follow past tense pattern
     - Changed `waypoint:set` → `waypoint:placed` to use more descriptive past tense action
   - In EnvironmentSystem:
     - Changed `game:pause` → `game:paused` and `game:resume` → `game:resumed` for consistency
     - Changed `weather:change` → `weather:changed` to follow past tense pattern
     - Changed `environment:update` → `environment:updated` to follow past tense pattern
     - Updated corresponding method names to match standardized event names

## Features of the Event Standardization System

The Event Standardization system consists of:

1. **EventManager**: Core event bus with standardized event handling
   - Implements the pub/sub pattern for component communication
   - Provides validation for event names and payloads
   - Includes helper methods for creating standardized event objects

2. **EventStandardizationImplementer**: Utility to help implement standardization
   - Maps old event names to standardized names
   - Provides templates for standardized event payloads
   - Includes tools for analyzing and migrating components

## Naming Conventions

Events follow two patterns:
- Standard events: `namespace:action` (e.g., `health:changed`)
- Component-specific events: `namespace:id:action` (e.g., `ui:health-display:visible`)

Actions are consistently named using past tense for events that have occurred:
- ✅ `changed` (not `change`)
- ✅ `activated` (not `activate`)
- ✅ `position-changed` (not `position`)
- ✅ `modal-shown` (not `showModal`)

## Current Progress

As of May 23, 2025, the following progress has been made:

| System | Progress | Components Updated |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Notification System | 100% | NotificationManager, KillFeed, EventBanner, AchievementDisplay |
| Combat System | 100% | HitIndicator, CombatSystem, EnhancedHitIndicator, DamageIndicator |
| Movement System | 100% | MovementSystem, FootstepIndicator |
| HUD System | 90% | MinimapSystem, CompassDisplay, StaminaSystem |
| Menu System | 80% | WorldMap, ScreenManager |
| Environment System | 100% | ObjectiveMarkerSystem, EnvironmentSystem |
| Progression System | 100% | PlayerRank, ExperienceBar, SkillPointsDisplay |
| Overall | 70% | - |

## Remaining Work

1. **Component Migration**:
   - Continue updating UI components to use standardized event names
   - Check other menu components for `ui:showModal` occurrences and update to `ui:modal-shown`
   - Next targets for standardization:
     - WeatherSystem (closely related to EnvironmentSystem)
     - DangerZone (part of environment system)
     - PowerupDisplay (completes environment system)
     - Remaining HUD components
   - Audit remaining components for non-standard event naming

2. **Event Payload Standardization**:
   - Update event payloads to follow standard templates
   - Implement payload validation where appropriate

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a comprehensive event catalog with all standard events
   - Document standardized payload structures for each event type

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Clear patterns make the codebase more predictable
- **Discoverability**: Standardized naming makes events easier to find and understand
- **Maintainability**: Common patterns reduce the learning curve for new developers
- **Reliability**: Validation helps catch errors early

## Testing

To verify event standardization:
1. Use `EventStandardizationImplementer.analyzeComponent()` to check components
2. Run the event standardization tests to verify compatibility
3. Manually test affected components to ensure functionality is maintained
